Evaluate this Shadow Writing attempt with DETAILED step-by-step analysis:

<thinking>
===================
STEP 1: Grammar Structure Preservation (0-3 points) 【骨架保持】
===================

Sub-step 1.1 - Identify Original Structure:
- Sentence pattern: [describe: SVO / clauses / complex structure]
- Main clause(s): [identify]
- Subordinate clause(s): [identify if any]
- Key conjunctions/connectors: [list]

Sub-step 1.2 - Identify Migrated Structure:
- Sentence pattern: [describe: SVO / clauses / complex structure]
- Main clause(s): [identify]
- Subordinate clause(s): [identify if any]
- Key conjunctions/connectors: [list]

Sub-step 1.3 - Structure Comparison:
- Are they IDENTICAL? [yes/no]
- If no, list differences: [describe each structural deviation]
- Number of deviations: [0 / 1-2 / 3+]

Sub-step 1.4 - Calculate Score:
- 0 deviations → 3 points (Perfect match)
- 1-2 minor deviations → 2 points
- 3+ or significant changes → 1 point
- Completely different → 0 points
Step 1 Score: [0-3]

===================
STEP 2: Content Word/Phrase Replacement Quality (0-2 points) 【内容替换】
===================

Sub-step 2.1 - List All Replacements:
- Replacement 1: [original word/phrase] → [migrated word/phrase]
- Replacement 2: [original word/phrase] → [migrated word/phrase]
- ... (list all content word changes)

Sub-step 2.2 - Check Each Replacement:
For EACH replacement above, answer:
- Is it a natural English collocation? [yes/no]
- Does it maintain the same grammatical function? [yes/no]
- Example: noun→noun, verb phrase→verb phrase, adjective→adjective

Sub-step 2.3 - Function Words Check:
- Were function words (prepositions, articles, verb forms) properly adjusted? [yes/no]
- Examples of adjustments: [list if any]

Sub-step 2.4 - Calculate Score:
- ALL replacements natural + function words adjusted → 2 points
- Most replacements work, 1-2 minor issues → 1 point
- Unnatural/grammatically incorrect → 0 points
Step 2 Score: [0-2]

===================
STEP 3: Semantic Plausibility & Logic (0-3 points) 【语义合理性 - CRITICAL】
===================

[WARNING] CRITICAL CHECK - Examine CAREFULLY for logical contradictions

Sub-step 3.1 - Time Sequence Logic (时间序列逻辑):
Question: Does the timeline make sense?
- Original time elements: [identify: when, how long, sequence]
- Migrated time elements: [identify: when, how long, sequence]
- Analysis: [Describe the time flow in both sentences]
- Check for timing conflicts:
  * Are there "already X" → "will be Y" contradictions? [yes/no + explain]
  * Are there improper tense uses? [yes/no + explain]
  * Example issue: "infected" (already) → "will be hospitalized" (future) [ERROR]
  * Example correct: "in critical condition" → "will die" (OK)
- Sub-result: [OK / ISSUE + explain]

Sub-step 3.2 - Cause-Effect Logic (因果关系):
Question: Do the cause-effect relationships make sense?
- Original: IF [cause] THEN [effect] → [identify both]
- Migrated: IF [cause] THEN [effect] → [identify both]
- Are they logically parallel?
- Check for illogical relationships:
  * Does "no treatment" lead to logical consequence? [yes/no + explain]
  * Example issue: "no treatment" → "will be hospitalized" [ERROR] (illogical)
  * Example correct: "no treatment" → "will die/deteriorate" [OK] (logical)
- Sub-result: [OK / ISSUE + explain]

Sub-step 3.3 - Severity Matching (严重性匹配):
Question: Do the consequences match in severity?
- Original consequence: [identify] → Severity level: [low/medium/high/death]
- Migrated consequence: [identify] → Severity level: [low/medium/high/death]
- Are they comparable in severity? [yes/no + explain]
- Check for severity mismatches:
  * Example issue: "executed" (death) → "hospitalized" (treatment) [ERROR]
  * Example correct: "executed" → "die/killed" [OK]
  * Example correct: "injured" → "wounded" [OK]
- Sub-result: [OK / ISSUE + explain]

Sub-step 3.4 - Real-World Believability (现实可信度):
Question: Is the migrated sentence believable in the real world?
- Does the scenario make practical sense? [yes/no + explain]
- Are there any absurd or nonsensical elements? [yes/no + list]
- Would this happen in reality? [yes/no + reason]
- Sub-result: [OK / ISSUE + explain]

Sub-step 3.5 - Overall Logic Summary:
- Total issues found: [count from 3.1-3.4]
- Critical issues (major contradictions): [list]
- Minor issues (acceptable): [list]

Sub-step 3.6 - Calculate Score:
- 0 issues found → 3 points (Perfectly logical)
- 1 minor issue only → 2 points (Mostly logical)
- 1 critical issue OR 2+ minor issues → 1 point (Problematic)
- 2+ critical issues → 0 points (Illogical)
Step 3 Score: [0-3]

===================
STEP 4: Topic Migration Success (0-2 points) 【话题迁移】
===================

Sub-step 4.1 - Topic Identification:
- Original topic/domain: [identify clearly]
- Migrated topic/domain: [identify clearly]
- Topic change: [original] → [migrated]

Sub-step 4.2 - Migration Quality:
- Is the topic change clear and obvious? [yes/no]
- Is the new topic coherent and meaningful? [yes/no]
- Does it feel like Shadow Writing or just template filling? [Shadow/Template + reason]

Sub-step 4.3 - Calculate Score:
- Clear, meaningful migration + Shadow Writing feel → 2 points
- Weak or unclear topic change → 1 point
- No real migration or template filling → 0 points
Step 4 Score: [0-2]

===================
STEP 5: Learning Value (0-1 points) 【学习价值】
===================

- Can English learners benefit from this migration? [yes/no + explain]
- Does it demonstrate a useful, reusable sentence pattern? [yes/no]
- Is it practical and applicable to real communication? [yes/no]
Step 5 Score: [0-1]

===================
STEP 6: FINAL ASSESSMENT
===================

Total Score Calculation:
- Step 1 (Grammar): [score]/3
- Step 2 (Content): [score]/2
- Step 3 (Logic): [score]/3
- Step 4 (Topic): [score]/2
- Step 5 (Learning): [score]/1
- TOTAL: [sum]/11

Pass Threshold: ≥9 points (AND Logic must be ≥2/3)

Final Judgment:
- Does this PASS quality standards? [yes/no]
- Key Strengths: [list what was done well]
- Key Issues: [list problems, especially from Step 3]
- Overall Assessment: [Shadow Writing OR Template Filling]
