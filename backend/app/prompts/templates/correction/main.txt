You are a TED sentence migration improvement specialist. Use step-by-step thinking to improve this failed migration.

ORIGINAL SENTENCE: "{original}"
FAILED MIGRATION: "{imitation}"
FAILED WORD MAPPING: {word_map}

QUALITY EVALUATION RESULTS:
- Total Score: {quality_score}/11 (Failed - needs ≥9)
- Detailed Scores:
  * Grammar Structure: {step1_grammar}/3
  * Content Replacement: {step2_content}/2
  * Logic & Plausibility: {step3_logic}/3 {'(CRITICAL FAILURE)' if logic_veto else ''}
  * Topic Migration: {step4_topic}/2
  * Learning Value: {step5_learning}/1

CRITICAL LOGICAL ISSUES:
{chr(10).join('- ' + issue for issue in step3_issues) if step3_issues else '- None'}

QUALITY FEEDBACK: "{quality_reasoning}"

Please think step by step to create an improved migration:

<thinking>
Step 1 - Analyze Quality Feedback:
- Grammar Score: {step1_grammar}/3 - {'GOOD' if step1_grammar >= 2 else 'NEEDS IMPROVEMENT'}
- Content Score: {step2_content}/2 - {'GOOD' if step2_content >= 1 else 'NEEDS IMPROVEMENT'}
- Logic Score: {step3_logic}/3 - {'CRITICAL ISSUE' if step3_logic < 2 else 'ACCEPTABLE'}
- Topic Score: {step4_topic}/2 - {'GOOD' if step4_topic >= 1 else 'NEEDS IMPROVEMENT'}
- Learning Score: {step5_learning}/1 - {'GOOD' if step5_learning >= 1 else 'NEEDS IMPROVEMENT'}

Focus on the LOWEST scoring dimensions, especially Logic if < 2/3

Step 2 - Identify Root Problems Based on Scores:
- Logic problems ({step3_logic}/3): {chr(10).join(step3_issues) if step3_issues else 'Check time sequence, cause-effect, severity matching'}
- Grammar problems ({step1_grammar}/3): [analyze if structure preservation failed]
- Content problems ({step2_content}/2): [check if word replacements were unnatural]
- Topic problems ({step4_topic}/2): [check if topic migration was unclear]
- Learning problems ({step5_learning}/1): [check if pattern is not useful]

Step 3 - Plan Improvements (Focus on Failed Dimensions):
PRIORITY: Fix Logic issues first if step3_logic < 2!
- If Logic failed: Fix time sequence, cause-effect, severity matching
  * Ensure consequences match severity (death→death, injury→injury)
  * Check "already X" doesn't lead to "will be Y"
  * Verify cause-effect is logical
- If Grammar failed: Preserve sentence structure better
- If Content failed: Use more natural collocations
- If Topic failed: Choose clearer domain migration
- If Learning failed: Make pattern more useful/reusable

Step 4 - Create Improved Migration:
- Write NEW migrated sentence addressing ALL issues above
- Provide improved word mapping with 2-3 alternatives each
- Verify: Logic [OK], Grammar [OK], Content [OK], Topic [OK], Learning [OK]
</thinking>

Based on my analysis above, here is the improved migration that addresses the failed dimensions:

{{"original": "{original}", "imitation": "<improved_migrated_sentence>", "map": {{"word1": ["alt1", "alt2", "alt3"], "word2": ["alt1", "alt2", "alt3"]}}}}
